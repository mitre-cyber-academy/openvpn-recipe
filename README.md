# OpenVPN Setup Recipe

This chef (confirmed working on Chef v12.4.0) recipe creates a server allowing users to VPN into the network it is connected to and waits on the scoreboard to pass it users to add to the box.

## Commands

This script adds the following commands to your path:

* openvpn-adduser
* openvpn-destroyuser

Both of these need to be run with administrative privileges.

Also you need port 1194 open for UDP traffic on the firewall.

## What is all this about watch keys?

This cookbook does more than just setup VPN. It also sets up the directory /opt/openvpn_keys and monitors for whenever a new text file is created in this directory. The reason for this is that [there is a rake task in the scoreboard recipe](https://github.com/mitre-cyber-academy/ctf-scoreboard/blob/e0a5e06329183caf6a008eaa07a489c67a9411d6/lib/tasks/scoreboard.rake#L126) that creates a new text file in a directory and then syncs that directory between the two machines. We use inotifywait and monitor for move requests since inotifywait ends up interpreting the rsync from the scoreboard as such.

## Commands to use this recipe for deployment

If you want to run this recipe on your server without using a full chef server install, you can use the following commands.

* `curl -L https://www.chef.io/chef/install.sh | sudo bash` # Install chef
* `cd openvpn-recipe` # Enter directory containing this code
* `berks vendor cookbooks` # fetch all cookbook dependencies and place in the cookbooks directory.
* `sudo chef-client -z -j node.json` # Run the chef client in standalone mode using the node.json provided.
* `sudo openvpn --genkey --secret /etc/openvpn/tc.key` # To generate the tls key if it hasn't already been generated.


## To Do

This recipe is setup to be very specific to the MITRE CTF at this point. In order to make it easier to move between infrastructures, many of the files need to be turned into templates. Some things that need to be made into attributes include

 * Diffie Hellman key size.
 * Root CA Expiration time.
 * IP address range to push to routes.
 * External IP and port for template-server-config.

## Using this Recipe

The easiest way to use this recipe is by cloning this repository to the machine on which you wish to install openvpn on and then running `sudo chef-client -z -j node.json`.
